### Lab for Cognition and Attention in Time and Space Projects

This repository contains the projects I've worked on during my time in the *Lab for Cognition and Attention in Time and Space*. This period lasted from **September 2023 to May 2024**.

**NOTE: These projects were directly downloaded to my own GitHub acccount from a lab mate. The original links are provided here:**

*Homography Transformation Tool:* https://github.com/JoshuaG-K/transformation-visualization-tool
*Stereo Camera Depth Tool*: https://github.com/JoshuaG-K/stereo-camera-depth-tool

The **Homography Transformation Tool** highlights various image transformation techniques, particularly those used for aligning images and calculating depth information. It also explores the effect of utilizing different matchers (SIFT and ORB) for feature detection between images. This notebook serves as a tutorial that demonstrates how to map one image's perspective onto another. 

The **Stereo Camera Depth Tool** is intended to give users a tutorial focused on depth calculations using stereo cameras. This notebook ensures to calibrate the stereo camera systems to make accurate depth measurements. Our methodology highly involves computing disparity maps to analyze the output of visual calibration methods, particularly the SGM algorithm that provides optimal performance.
